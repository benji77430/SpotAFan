YOU NEED THE GOOGLE API KEY TO USE THE DOWNLOADER PART OF THE APP

link of google api : https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3

notice there is auto report function if the app crash for a reason the log file will be send to me automaticaly but you can disable the option 

defender smart screen detect it as malicious but you can see the source code there is nothing to hide

if you prefere to use the python version don't forget to install the librairies with '''pip install -r requirements.txt or using setup.bat'''
